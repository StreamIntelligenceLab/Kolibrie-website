# Optimization

## Introduction

Efficient query planning and optimization are crucial for the performance and scalability of the Kolibrie Database Engine. Our system employs advanced, cost-based techniques to transform high-level SPARQL queries into efficient execution plans. Although the overall approach is inspired by established optimization strategies, such as those found in the Volcano optimizer, all internal implementation details are kept proprietary.

## Logical and Physical Operators

To enable flexible query execution, the engine separates the query processing into two distinct layers:

- **Logical Operators:**  
  These operators capture the high-level intent of a SPARQL query. They represent abstract operations such as scanning for triples, filtering based on conditions, projecting specific variables, and joining result sets. This abstraction allows us to reason about query semantics without committing to any specific execution method.

- **Physical Operators:**  
  These operators define the concrete methods used to execute the operations represented by the logical plan. They include strategies for accessing and processing data—such as full table scans, index-based scans, various join algorithms, and even parallel execution techniques. The physical operators are chosen during optimization based on their estimated cost and performance characteristics.

This separation allows the optimizer to explore multiple execution strategies and select the one that best balances performance with resource efficiency.

## Volcano Optimizer API

The Kolibrie Database Engine integrates a cost-based optimizer inspired by the Volcano framework. The optimizer’s role is to systematically evaluate different physical execution plans derived from a logical query plan, estimate their costs using statistical information, and select the most efficient plan.

Key high-level aspects of the Volcano Optimizer include:

- **Plan Exploration:**  
  The optimizer recursively examines different ways to execute each part of the logical plan. Although the optimizer considers various physical operators (e.g., different scan or join strategies), the exact algorithms and cost metrics remain internal.

- **Cost Estimation:**  
  While theoretical cost estimation methods (such as cardinality and selectivity estimation) are applied to gauge the expense of different execution strategies, the details of these estimations are not disclosed.

- **Plan Selection:**  
  After evaluating alternatives, the optimizer selects the physical plan that is estimated to yield the best performance. This plan is then executed against the database.

## Example Usage

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the Volcano Optimizer API in a high-level manner. Note that the underlying details of plan generation and cost estimation are abstracted away.

```rust
use kolibrie::parser::*;
use kolibrie::sparql_database::*;
use kolibrie::volcano_optimizer::*;
use std::time::Instant;

fn volcano_optimizer_example() {
    // Step 1: Initialize the database and load RDF data.
    let mut database = SparqlDatabase::new();
    // (RDF data generation and parsing details are abstracted)
    database.parse_rdf("...");

    // Step 2: Build indexes to support efficient query processing.
    database.build_all_indexes();

    // Step 3: Define a SPARQL query.
    let sparql_query = r#"
    PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/> 
    SELECT ?loved_person
    WHERE {
        <http://example.org/person5> ex:loves ?loved_person .
        ?loved_person ex:loves <http://example.org/person7>
    }"#;

    // Step 4: Parse the SPARQL query and construct a logical plan.
    // (Internal details are hidden; the function abstracts logical plan construction.)
    let logical_plan = build_logical_plan_from_query(sparql_query, &database);

    // Step 5: Initialize the optimizer and find the best physical execution plan.
    let mut optimizer = VolcanoOptimizer::new(&database);
    let physical_plan = optimizer.find_best_plan(&logical_plan);

    // Step 6: Execute the physical plan and measure performance.
    let start = Instant::now();
    let results = physical_plan.execute(&mut database);
    let duration = start.elapsed();

    println!("Query execution time: {:?}", duration);
    println!("Results: {:?}", results);
}

fn main() {
    volcano_optimizer_example();
}
```
